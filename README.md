# Offline-capable weather application using Multi-hop MANET and Wi-Fi Direct

Authors : Jan Magnus A. Mariano and Concepcion L. Khan

Existing weather applications only provide information one-way, but because weather reports can be inaccurate, users of these platforms need a way to be able to report the discrepancies between the weather report and the actual situation in a particular region. The system aims to create a mobile application which will allow users to receive weather data and forecasts as well as send appropriate feedback to the accuracy of the forecast even without the presence of proper network infrastructures. In order to achieve this, a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) utilizing the Wi-Fi Direct technology will be utilized.
